Problem Statement
We would like to build towards a system that, as stories are uploaded, is able to
flag them if they are suspected to contain copyrighted content.

Assume you are given a finite set of text files (in a directory), each of which
contains the complete text for one copyrighted story:
~/copyrighted_works:
harry_potter_and_the_philosophers_stone.txt
the_fellowship_of_the_ring.txt
twilight.txt
...

Design a program that, as a new story is uploaded by a user:
user_input_1.txt

...is able to generate some sort of similarity scores between the user upload and
the predefined list of copyrighted works. These scores may then be used to flag
stories for manual review.

We will call your program via a bash terminal (on macOS) as follows:
$: ./your_program -c ~/copyrighted_works -u ~/user_input_1.txt

...and expect output to be printed to stdout, in order of most to least similar copyrighted work:
harry_potter_and_the_philosophers_stone.txt : 0.5
twilight.txt : 0.2
the_fellowship_of_the_ring.txt : 0.1
...

We will refer to an optionally provided README.txt for instructions regarding the
running of your program (e.g. any required dependencies).

Please document any assumptions or tradeoffs that you are making with respect to
 both performance and output accuracy. This exercise is intentionally open ended
 so that you may build the program in a platform or language of your choosing.
 We encourage creative solutions to the problem at hand but arenâ€™t necessarily
 looking for a fully complete and robust approach. We will use your solution as
 a starting off point for our discussions during the next stage of the interview process.
